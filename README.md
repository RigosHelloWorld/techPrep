Prep for Technical Interview

I find the world of programming fun and exciting as well as challenging. With so many different ways to solve problems
there is not a clear cut road that one can take into the industry. 

With that said join me in my struggles and preperation for my technical interviews as I solve leetcode problems and try and 
grasp common algorithms in the industry.

Wish me luck!! Rigo Rosa
